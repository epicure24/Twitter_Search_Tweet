# Twitter_Search_Tweet

This a python program to crawl through the twitter API and get thousands of tweets related to a certain hashtag.
Don't forget to put your CONSUMER KEY AND ACCESS TOKEN.
Store your credentials in the Twitter_key.py file.
For the security reasons I am putting the CREDENTIALS value as 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXX'.

This program will fetch you the 10,000 tweets related or containing the #FOOD.
You can change the '#' value by changing the value of "food" to whatever you want to search.
